Selected Topic:

It is not uncommon for municipalities, counties, or any other form of government to modify or “right-size” its law enforcement departments. No matter the reasoning behind such right-sizing, good government requires an understanding of the data surrounding the causes and effects to a community of such decisions. To that end, we have decided to compile data to document the relationship between increases in law enforcement personnel, or conversely decreases, on the overall crime in a given community.

Assumptions: 	
			
      1) Political entities compared are symmetrical and similar in population, region, demographics …i.e. apples to apples comparison
      2) Comparisons are contemporaneous…it is assumed communities are compared within the same timeframe i.e. no comparisons to 1870s Wild West to modern 
      day urban areas
      3) Crime categories and locations compared are analogous….not comparing cattle rustling between Kansas and New York City…therefore the US top five 
      common felonies are compared
	
Reason For Selected Topic:

While the debate between law enforcement size and resourcing is certainly alive and well in contemporary society, our intent is NOT political nor is it driven by current events. The topic was chosen due to:
	
      1) The availability of ready data
      2) High probability of cause and effect relationships
      3) Up to date data is reliable; allowing controls and use of dependent and independent variables
      4) Crime statistics are easily understood and lend themselves to graphical display and geographical analysis thereby allowing our team to showcase 
       various aspects of the course and the material learned

Description of their source data: https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/downloads

Questions they hope to answer with the data: 

	1) How often do person crimes occur in each state?
	2) How often do property crimes occur in each state?
	3) How often do society crimes occur in each state?
	4) Is there a correlation between number of police agencies and crime? 


Communication Protocols

Our Team will utilize the collaborative nature of commonly used programs throughout the business world, most notably Slack and GitHub. Git Hub will be used exclusively for building and sharing coding utilizing its branch methodology. This will allow maximum collaboration and collective editing, review, and assistance from the team writ large.

Inter-Team communication will be achieved mainly through the application Slack. This allows the team to compartmentalize the project and separate communications channels from outside interference, or minimize confusion. In addition, Slack’s mobile capacity allows near instant communication within the team regardless of their current status, while further allowing related messaging to be shared within the team and only within the team. 

Face to Face collaboration will be achieved via Zoom during the standard class meeting times. This is critical. As the team is used to blocking off this time frame, this allows unfettered communications without disruption of family, work, and to maintain routine. 

Industry standard communications protocols remain in effect. To wit:

Zoom meetings will be attended with video on, and camera operating
When not speaking, microphone will be muted
Slack channels will be uncluttered and used only for official communications related to the project to ensure confusion is minimized.
