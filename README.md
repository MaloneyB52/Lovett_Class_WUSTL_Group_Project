Selected Topic:

It is not uncommon for municipalities, counties, or any other form of government to modify or “right-size” its law enforcement departments. No matter the reasoning behind such right-sizing, good government requires an understanding of the data surrounding the causes and effects to a community of such decisions. To that end, we have decided to compile data to document the relationship between increases in law enforcement personnel, or conversely decreases, on the overall crime in a given community.

Assumptions: 	
			
      1) Political entities compared are symmetrical and similar in population, region, demographics …i.e. apples to apples comparison
      2) Comparisons are contemporaneous…It is assumed communities are compared within the same timeframe i.e. no comparisons to 1870s Wild West to modern 
      day urban areas
      3) Crime categories and locations compared are analogous….not comparing cattle rustling between Kansas and New York City…therefore the US top five 
      common felonies are compared
	
Reason For Selected Topic:

While the debate between law enforcement size and resourcing is certainly alive and well in contemporary society, our intent is NOT political nor is it driven by current events. The topic was chosen due to:
	
      1) The availability of ready data
      2) High probability of cause and effect relationships
      3) Up to date data is reliable; allowing controls and use of dependent and independent variables
      4) Crime statistics are easily understood and lend themselves to graphical display and geographical analysis thereby allowing our team to showcase 
       various aspects of the course and the material learned

Description of their source data: TBD

Questions they hope to answer with the data: 

	1) What are the top 5 safest states in the United States regarding specific crimes?
	2) What regions of the United States are more likely to expereince specific crimes?
	3) Is there a correlation between population and crime?
	4) Is there a correlation between number of police agencies and crime?
