   <h1>Crime in the US</h1>
   <p>
    It is not uncommon for municipalities, counties, or any other form of government to modify or “right-size” its law enforcement departments. No matter the reasoning behind such right-sizing, good government requires an understanding of the data surrounding the causes and effects to a community of such decisions. To that end, we have decided to compile data to document the relationship between increases in law enforcement personnel, or conversely decreases, on the overall crime in a given community.

   <ul>
     Assumptions
        <li>Political entities compared are symmetrical and similar in population, region, demographics …i.e. apples to apples comparison</li>
        <li>Comparisons are contemporaneous…it is assumed communities are compared within the same timeframe i.e. no comparisons to 1870s Wild West to modern 
          day urban areas</li>
        <li>Crime categories and locations compared are analogous….not comparing cattle rustling between Kansas and New York City…therefore the US top five 
          common felonies are compared</li>
   </ul>
