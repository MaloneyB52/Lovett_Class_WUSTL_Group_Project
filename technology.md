# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis 
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an initial analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python and Matplotlib.

## Database Storage
Our data will be store in Postgres SQL, AWS RDS, and possibly AWS S3 depending on size. 

## Machine Learning 
We have not determined our machine learning library. Once our database has been created and analyzed we will revisit this decision. 

## Dashboard 
We will create an interactive dashboard using a Flask template and Bootstrap. It will be hosted on an html webpage.
